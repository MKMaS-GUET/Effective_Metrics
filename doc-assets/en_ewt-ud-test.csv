Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
TEHRAN ( AFP ) -
An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in , " Masoud Shojai , head of the country 's " Iran Cartoon " association and the fair organizer , said .
" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison , " he added .
" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ? "
Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran 's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum 
He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000 , 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively .
This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday , though they were still meeting pockets of resistance .
The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants , including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al - Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars .
Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday , leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul , Baiji , and Tuz .
Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah , as well , according to az - Zaman .
The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah .
Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack .
Allawi 's aged cousin and the man 's wife and daughter - in - law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped .
In Iraqi society , PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan , including especially his first cousins , so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him .
The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday , but still face pockets of resistance .
If Samarra and other cities are any guide , those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come .
The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections .
He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party , which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote , is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation .
The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections .
Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault , both in Iraq and in Washington .
For some black satire on Fallujah , see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog .
[ Am at a conference and ca n't blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days . ]
The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons .
Al - Qaeda wants them , Iran wants them , Russia wants the better ones , and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal .
For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran ’s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
At the same time , an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program .
Arial photos , loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented .
Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world ’s ever seen .
President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have .
With the demand so high , the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons .
Right now that seems to be the US , EU , and IAEA .
But not always do those three agree , and not always are their decisions equal .
The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran , yet Israel , which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons , ranks around fifth in nuclear strength .
It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern .
North Korea ’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago .
It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons .
But getting past who should get them , is who has them , and who is really close .
The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu .
Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched , somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq .
America cried wolf in Iraq , and what ’s scary is that sooner or later , that wolf will probably get us .
A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp. , New York , after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction , the companies said .
Primerica , which had owned nearly 70 % of Williams , will pay about 16.7 million shares , currently valued at almost $ 472 million , for the rest of Williams .
The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share .
Williams shares , which were to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday , closed at $ 23.25 , off 12.5 cents .
Primerica closed at $ 28.25 , down 50 cents .
Williams , Duluth , Ga. , is an insurance and financial-services holding company .
Its subsidiaries ' services are marketed by closely held A.L. Williams & Associates .
Primerica , as expected , also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Intelogic Trace Inc. , San Antonio , Texas , said it bought 2.7 million shares , or about 18 % , of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share , or $ 9.9 million .
The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help prevent Martin Ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern .
Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp. , an Intelogic affiliate .
The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives `` to maximize shareholder value , '' including the possible sale of the company .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $ 2.75 .
Mr. Edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves , saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when `` the company is on a roll . ''
He added , `` This has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed , particularly , to take the company private . ''
But Mr. Ackerman said the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that Mr. Edelman is running scared .
Dow Jones & Co. said it extended its $ 18-a-share offer for Telerate Inc. common stock until 5 p.m. EST Nov. 9 .
The offer , valued at about $ 576 million for the 33 % of Telerate that Dow Jones does n't already own , had been set to expire Nov. 6 .
Dow Jones , which owns about 64 million of Telerate 's 95 million common shares outstanding , said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer .
Telerate 's two independent directors have rejected the offer as inadequate .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed at $ 19.50 , up 12.5 cents .
Telerate provides an electronic financial information network .
Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , and community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases .
Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
The aerospace , automotive supply , electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough .
In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .
Still , he added , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million .
For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a share .
That compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier .
The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share .
Sales rose 4 % to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion .
Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment .
Overall , pretax electronics earnings soared 12 % to $ 107.9 million from $ 96.4 million .
All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 .
For the year , electronics emerged as Rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings , muscling out aerospace for the first time .
The graphics business , which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive , saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79 % to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million .
For the year , bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press , graphics earnings almost doubled .
Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .
That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines .
The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship , according to analysts .
For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 .
Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .
Sales for the year rose 5 % to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988 .
Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5 % to 17 % .
The Austin , Texas-based company , which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories , said its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor .
That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .
A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor , with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $ 5,699 , down from $ 6,799 .
Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors , which the Dell models use , generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen .
World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar this crop year and next .
Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might have to buy a large quantity of sugar .
Although traders rushed to buy futures contracts , many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development , which could n't be confirmed , analysts said .
The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day .
The March delivery , which has no limits , settled at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent a pound .
The May contract , which also is without restraints , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents .
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents , while other contract months showed near-limit advances .
According to reports carried by various news services , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential-Bache Securities , New York , estimated that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline .
`` This is a demand that must be met , regardless of the price of oil , '' said Mr. Stevenson .
Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world .
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated .
During the current crop year , Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89 .
Its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in
`` It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year , '' explained Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
`` Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .
As a result , Ms. Ganes said , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .
Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said .
Most important , Ms. Ganes noted , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports . ''
Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , said : `` I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound . ''
Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted , the situation is extremely confused .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said .
Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY :
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain .
The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October .
COPPER :
Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains .
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 .
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .
However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
Separately , Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months .
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea .
The parent of Younkers , after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores , said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing .
Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June , when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business .
But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer .
He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 % .
Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed changing the offer for the company to $ 13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction .
Under terms of the new proposal , Equus , managed by Equus Capital Corp. , Houston , would pay $ 12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $ 1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama 's 2.1 million shares outstanding .
Previously , it offered $ 13.65 a share in cash , or $ 29 million .
The El Paso , Texas , maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12 % rate , but would n't be paid for the first two years .
The stock would be redeemed in five years , subject to terms of the surviving company 's debt .
Neither Equus nor Tony Lama gave a reason for the changed offer and Tony Lama could n't be reached for comment .
However , Tony Lama said it would promptly submit the offer to a special committee of the company 's board .
Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests , a move the news organization termed an `` amicable separation . ''
Mr. Reupke , 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran , had been the information-services company 's general manager for only six months .
His appointment to that post , which has senior administrative , staff and policy responsibilities , followed a several-year tenure as Reuters 's editor in chief .
No successor was named , and Mr. Reupke 's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives , the company said .
In a telephone interview , Mr. Reupke said his departure was for `` personal reasons , '' which he declined to specify .
`` There is no business reason for my departure , '' nor any disagreement over policy , he added .
He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager 's post had n't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization .
Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters 's eight-person executive committee who did n't also serve on the company 's board of directors .
`` If I were choosing the people of tomorrow , I would have chosen the people who are now on the board , '' he said .
A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects `` no change in strategy or profits . ''
Mark Shepperd , an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London , said , `` I suspect ( the departure ) will be fairly irrelevant for the company .
I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations . ''
On London 's Stock Exchange , Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence ( $ 14.43 ) .
In the U.S. over-the-counter market , American depositary shares for Reuters , each representing three shares in the London market , closed unchanged at $ 43.875 .
The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke 's duties is Nigel Judah , 58 , finance director and a Reuters board director .
Peter Holland , 45 , deputy general manager , becomes director of corporate affairs .
And Patrick Mannix , 46 , international technical manager , becomes director of group quality programs .
DD Acquisition Corp. , a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd. , extended to Nov. 20 its $ 45-a-share offer for all Dunkin' Donuts Inc. shares outstanding .
The offer , which was due to expire yesterday , is conditional on 50.1 % of Dunkin' common shares , on a fully diluted basis , being tendered and on the withdrawal of the company 's poison pill rights plan .
DD Acquisition has launched a suit in a Delaware court seeking the withdrawal of Dunkin 's poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans , which it claims were put in place to deter bidders .
DD Acquisition said 2.2 million shares , or about 38.5 % of the shares outstanding , have been tendered under its offer .
The partners said they already hold 15 % of all shares outstanding .
Dunkin' has set Nov. 10 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids .
DD Acquisition said the extension is to allow this process to be completed .
Dunkin' is based in Randolph , Mass .
Cara , a food services chain operator and Unicorp , a holding company , are based in Toronto .
Savin Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 35.2 million , or 31 cents a share , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 3.8 million , or one cent a share .
A spokesman for the Stamford , Conn.based company said operations had a loss of $ 5.5 million for the quarter ; in addition , the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $ 23.5 million and $ 8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as `` unusual . ''
The charges were partly offset by a $ 2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures , he said .
Revenue declined 8 % to $ 85.7 million , from $ 93.3 million a year earlier .
Savin cited `` a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes .
Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $ 17 million to $ 19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices .
The Oklahoma City energy and defense concern said it will record a $ 7.5 million reserve for its defense group , including a $ 4.7 million charge related to problems under a fixed-price development contract and $ 2.8 million in overhead costs that wo n't be reimbursed .
In addition , Hadson said it will write off about $ 3.5 million in costs related to international exploration leases where exploration efforts have been unsuccessful .
The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss .
A year earlier , net income was $ 2.1 million , or six cents a share , on revenue of $ 169.9 million .
A lack of enthusiasm with the latest economic data hampered the stock market 's bid to extend Tuesday 's sharp gains , as prices closed slightly higher in sluggish trading .
While renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover activity boosted several so-called deal stocks , traders said profit-taking weighed on the market , with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had jumped 41.60 points on Tuesday , drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90 .

The October survey of corporate purchasing managers , as expected , provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued .
An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6 % ; a reading above 50 % would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving .
But with the index proving somewhat better than expected and the widely anticipated report on October employment scheduled to arrive tomorrow , stock prices firmed only modestly in response to the report and then faltered .
`` This market 's still going through its pains , '' said Philip Puccio , head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities .
`` The psychology is still : ` We want ( stocks ) up , but if they do n't carry we 're going to sell them . ' ''
Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio said .
Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips .
Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates .

Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen , climbing 17 % from 1.637 trillion yen in the year-earlier period .
Nissan scheduled a seven-yen interim dividend payment , unchanged .
Atsushi Muramatsu , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nissan , said , `` The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987 , when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties .
`` It can be said that the trend of financial improvement has been firmly set , '' he added .
Heritage Media Corp. , New York , said it offered to buy the shares of POP Radio Corp. it does n't already own in a stock swap .
Heritage , which owns 51 % of POP 's 3.6 million shares outstanding , said it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each POP common share it does n't already own .
Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction , Heritage would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares , a Heritage spokesman estimated .
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , POP plunged $ 4 to $ 14.75 .
The preferred stock , which would have a dividend rate of $ 1.76 a year , would be convertible into Heritage common at a rate of four common shares for each preferred .
New York-based POP Radio provides , through a national , in-store network , a customized music , information and advertising service which simulates live radio .
Heritage owns and operates television and radio stations and in-store advertising and promotion programs .
GenCorp Inc. , hurt by a plant accident and other unexpected costs , said it expects to report that fiscal fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations will be significantly below last year 's $ 25 million .
The Fairlawn , Ohio-based company also said that full-year profit from continuing operations will be far below last year 's $ 148 million .
Last year 's figures include a one-time loss of $ 12 million for restructuring and unusual items .
But the automotive parts and aerospace concern expects that net for the year ending Nov. 30 will exceed last fiscal year 's net of $ 70 million , or $ 2.19 a share , primarily because of $ 200 million in gains from sales of discontinued operations .
Harry Millis , an analyst at McDonald & Co. in Cleveland , said GenCorp 's unanticipated losses come largely from an accident at a government-owned assembly plant in Kansas , run by a private subcontractor , that makes cluster bombs for GenCorp 's Aerojet Ordnance business .
Transamerica Corp. , San Francisco , said third-quarter profit was essentially flat despite a large one-time gain a year earlier .
The insurance and financial services concern said profit for the quarter rose 1.1 % to $ 93.9 million , or $ 1.19 a share , compared with $ 92.9 million , or $ 1.18 a share , the year earlier .
The results reflected a 24 % gain in income from its finance businesses , and a 15 % slide in income from insurance operations .
Transamerica said third-quarter investment gains were $ 10.2 million , compared with $ 6.4 million the year earlier .
It said insurance profit reflected a $ 6 million loss from Hurricane Hugo .
It also estimated that losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California would be no more than $ 6 million , and would be included in fourth-quarter results .
RMS International Inc. , Hasbrouk Heights , N.J. , facing a cash-flow squeeze , said it is seeking other financing sources and waivers from debenture holders .
The company said that because of softening sales it is n't in compliance with requirements that it maintain $ 3 million in working capital .
RMS distributes electronic devices and produces power supplies and plastic literature displays .
RMS said it had a loss of $ 158,666 , or 10 cents a share , in the third quarter , compared with a year-earlier loss of $ 26,956 , or two cents a share .
Sales rose to $ 3 million from $ 2.9 million .

Sales rose to $ 9.8 million from $ 8.9 million .
Meridian National Corp. said it sold 750,000 shares of its common stock to the McAlpine family interests , for $ 1 million , or $ 1.35 a share .
The sale represents 10.2 % of Meridian 's shares outstanding .
The McAlpine family , which operates a number of multinational companies , including a London-based engineering and construction company , also lent to Meridian National $ 500,000 .
That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $ 2 a share during its one-year term .
The loan may be extended by the McAlpine group for an additional year with an increase in the conversion price to $ 2.50 a share .
The sale of shares to the McAlpine family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of Meridian stock to Haden MacLellan Holding PLC of Surrey , England and a recent public offering have increased Meridian 's net worth to $ 8.5 million , said William Feniger , chief executive officer of Toledo , Ohio-based Meridian .
Ratners Group PLC , a fast-growing , acquisition-minded London-based jeweler , raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfield 's Inc. to $ 57.50 a share , or $ 62.1 million , from $ 50 a share , or $ 55 million , after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratners 's initial offer .
The other concern was n't identified .
Ratners 's chairman , Gerald Ratner , said the deal remains of `` substantial benefit to Ratners . ''
In London at mid-afternoon yesterday , Ratners 's shares were up 2 pence ( 1.26 cents ) , at 260 pence ( $ 1.64 ) .
The sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50 % of Weisfield 's shareholders , and it is scheduled for completion by Dec. 10 .
The acquisition of 87-store Weisfield 's raises Ratners 's U.S. presence to 450 stores .
About 30 % of Ratners 's profit already is derived from the U.S. .
Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from Finland have been averted .
Last week , Miami-based Carnival disclosed that Waertsilae Marine Industries , the Finnish shipyard that is building Carnival 's new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy .
Yesterday , Carnival said a new company has been formed in Finland that will carry on Waertsilae 's shipbuilding operations .
Carnival said it will be an 11 % shareholder in the new company .
Carnival said the Fantasy , a 2,050-passenger ship that was slated to be delivered this month , will be delivered in January .
A second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991 .
Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered next fall .
A planned third ship still may be built in the Finnish shipyard , or may be built elsewhere , Carnival said .
Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association took an $ 89.9 million charge as it reported a third-quarter loss of $ 70.7 million , or $ 12.09 a share .
The Van Nuys , Calif. , thrift had net income of $ 132,000 , or three cents a share , a year ago .
The bulk of the pretax charge is a $ 62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary , which the company said had been a big drain on earnings .
The company said the one-time provision would substantially eliminate all future losses at the unit .
Valley Federal also added $ 18 million to realestate loan reserves and eliminated $ 9.9 million of good will .
The thrift said that `` after these charges and assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates , the association expects to achieve near record earnings in 1990 . ''
Valley Federal is currently being examined by regulators .
New loans continue to slow ; they were $ 6.6 million in the quarter compared with $ 361.8 million a year ago .
The thrift has assets of $ 3.2 billion .
First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about $ 250 million .
First of America , which now has 45 banks and $ 12.5 billion in assets , announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria , Ill. , bank holding company in January .
Midwest Financial has $ 2.3 billion in assets and eight banks .
The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990 , when each will adopt the First of America name .
Kalamazoo , Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company .
First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America .
But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America 's operating results for 1989 by $ 3 million to $ 4 million , or 15 cents to 20 cents a share .
Coleco Industries Inc. , a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at $ 65 a share in the early 1980s , filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders .
Under the plan , unsecured creditors , who are owed about $ 430 million , would receive about $ 92 million , or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed .
In addition , they will receive stock in the reorganized company , which will be named Ranger Industries Inc .
After these payments , about $ 225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding .
The Avon , Conn. , company 's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer , but the product was plagued with glitches and the company 's fortunes plunged .
But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls , whose sales hit $ 600 million in 1985 .
But as the craze died , Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988 .
The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court .

Xerox Corp. has told employees in its Crum & Forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people , or 25 % of the staff .
A spokeswoman for Crum & Forster said employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move .
She said the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $ 4 million to be spread over the next three quarters .
By comparison , for the first nine months , Xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion .
Earnings at Xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly , but that was largely because capital gains at Crum & Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments .

Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation , a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor .
All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds .
Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market .
And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes .
Columbia stock recently hit 4 1/8 , after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private .
Moreover , junk professionals think Columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough , meaning another markdown could be coming .
But in recent days , Columbia has edged up , closing at 5 1/4 , up 3/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure .
Mr. Spiegel 's fans say Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .
That 's almost $ 10 of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion .
Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands .
The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer .
While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia 's junk problems .
Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
Columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation .
But like other thrifts , it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity .
Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so .
New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years .
That 's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right .
Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't provide current data on its junk .
But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered .
These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value .
Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings .
One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up , as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank .
But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .
Some think Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence .
The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say .
Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say .
It is n't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders .
But `` the concept is workable .
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York .
Mr. Spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street .
Few people think Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become .
`` They are n't really a thrift , '' says Jonathan Gray , a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst .
Of course , regulators would have to approve Columbia 's reorganization .
And some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel 's past junk-bond trades .

Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein .
The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology .
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it .
Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment , bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders , Genetics Institute said .
The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1 , a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage .
The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects , Genetics Institute said .
The company added that it has filed patent applications `` on a large number of different BMP proteins '' and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received .
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers , the company said .
The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . ''
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter .
Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court .
Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -LCB- and -RCB- respect for the law . ''
A senior Justice Department official , however , said the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating .
`` We 're pleased the ABA rated him qualified , '' David Runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said in an interview .
The ABA gives a `` qualified '' rating to nominees it believes would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench .
In contrast , the lawyers ' association gives a `` well qualified '' rating to those `` regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy .
Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51 % of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Metallgesellschaft , a diversified Frankfurt , West Germany-based metals group , said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants .
Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said .
The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units , the company said .
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ( $ 434.4 million ) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock .
A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry .
Because of the rulings , the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act .
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market .
ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .
Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million from Taiwan , $ 400 million from South Korea and $ 125 million from Hong Kong , according to the ITC .
In another action , the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington , Del. , against imports of neoprene , a type of synthetic rubber , from France and West Germany .
These imports totaled about $ 17 million last year .
Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge .
Upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan .
But the pharmaceutical company said it `` anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . ''
The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % .
In addition , Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay .
Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program . ''
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .
`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .
According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan .
Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced .
As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece .
An Upjohn spokesman said he had `` heard nothing '' to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors .
The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy .
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said .

Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .
The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation .
Although started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 ( A ) minority business program .
This is a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses .
Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico .
The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .
Instead of 50/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
Besides being a `` minority-owned company '' Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .
Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi ( now serving a jail sentence ) , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese .
Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .
When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
Wedtech management used the merit system .
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .
If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person .
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading .
None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .
The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .
Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 ( A ) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .
They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''
Programs like Section 8 ( A ) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .
Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .
They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .
Why are programs like this not eliminated ?
`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983-85 .
The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships .
The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard 's losses , participants said .
`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business .
Everything will be taken over by the new company , '' said Christian Andersson , executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine .
Once its ownership is finalized , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities .
Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said .
Under an accord signed yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ( $ 23.5 million ) .
Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , and take a minority stake in the new company .
Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine 's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital , government officials said .
Waertsilae Marine 's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc .
Carnival , which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine , presented claims for $ 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week .
Waertsilae Marine 's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court .
Its plans to be acquired dashed , Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital .
In all , the company hopes to repay $ 45 million in debt through the sales , which will completely discharge its secured debt , the company said .
In addition , the company has replaced its president and chief executive , naming W. James Nichol , head of the company 's contract health services , to succeed B. Lee Karns .
Mr. Nichol said he was `` extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months . ''
Concurrent with Mr. Nichol 's appointment , Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine , Calif. , to St. Louis , where the company maintained its contract services offices .
Mr. Karns continues as chairman .
Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk , Va. , but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Comprehensive Care closed at $ 3.75 a share , up 12.5 cents .
Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47 % decline in fourth-quarter earnings , reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market .
The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier .
Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion .
For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share .
This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations .
Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion .
Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company .
The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said .
Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending .
For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said .
Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion .
The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added .
Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America .
Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50 , off $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .

Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .
First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $ 55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .
The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .
River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets .
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January , which would be a strain in most years .
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas .
`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert .
`` It is going to be real tight . ''
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time .
In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River .
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month .
At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed , an Army Corps spokesman said .
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .
So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel .
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .
Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .
In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn .
Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa .
It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .
`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .
Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .
Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans .
One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore .
And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace .
The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays .
The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market .
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .
Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .
December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .
January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 .
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York .
`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said .
Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said .
Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said .
Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said .
Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .
COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike .
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .
In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said .
Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike .
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .
In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .
Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold .
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .
The September index was 47.1 % .
A reading below 50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50 % points to expansion .
The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50 % .
NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers .
The new software is based on Novell Inc. 's NetWare network operating system software .
USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .
The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share .
The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million .
In the 1988 period , USX also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement .
Sales rose 5 % to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing .
However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .
Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .
Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .
Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd .
In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million .
Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said .
Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales .
The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .
Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year .
He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .
The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .
Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .
The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million .
USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .
Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares .
The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 .
USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .
The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .
Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .
Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .
John F. Barrett , 40 , formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer , posts which had been vacant .
Leon J. Level , vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern , and F. Warren McFarlan , a professor at Harvard University 's Graduate School of Business , were elected directors , increasing board membership to nine .
David A. DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named president and chief operating officer in August .
Two leading constitutional-law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto .
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .
Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .
But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . ''
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Trinity said it plans to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year .
